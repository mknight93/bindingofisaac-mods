    <description>[b]All stats up... with adverse effects.[/b]

Mephedrone is a silly item that would be completely insane with Scapular and some patience.

Picking the item up gives you an all stats up, but every time you get hit, your stats are randomly raised or lowered.

Mephedrone can appear in a bunch of pools - have a look at the itempools.xml in the mod folder for more information!

[b]Stuff to do![/b]
- Although I updated the item to only give you the initial stats up once, if you were to pick up a duplicated version of this item, you wouldn't receive the bonus a second time. I'll look into improving that for the future!
- Maybe tweak the variance a bit so you're not completely fucked over by taking damage. Or don't, depends how everyone feels about pure RNG luck.</description>
