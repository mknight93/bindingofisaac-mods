    <description>An awfully sadistic curse for people who hate themselves.

Every time you get hit, your active item is completely drained of all of its charges.

Currently the curse is permanently active. I'll look at sorting that out. If you want to ruin your life entirely, enjoy it in its current state!

[b]Stuff to do![/b]
- Add a banner under each floor name with the curse instead of the fortune teller banner.
- Set the curse to only have a chance to activate.</description>
